# Examples

These are SolidJS translations of the [Radix Themes](https://www.radix-ui.com/themes) example layouts, built using headless components from this library.

These are totally AI makde so they dont look perfect like the originals.
It can be made to look just like the originals but I dont have the time to do it.
